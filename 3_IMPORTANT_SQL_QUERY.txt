1. BETWEEN : Selects stock with a quantity between 100 and 150
SELECT * FROM stock
WHERE quantity BETWEEN 100 AND 150;

SELCT * FROM stock
WHERE quantity NOT BETWEEN 100 AND 150;


CASE :         Change query output depending on conditions. 
              Example: Returns users and their subscriptions, along with a new column called activity_levels

BETWEEN  :-    SELECT * FROM stock
               WHERE quantity BETWEEN 100 AND 150;

                SELECT * FROM stock
                 WHERE quantity NOT BETWEEN 100 AND 150;

CASE:- Change query output depending on conditions
Example: Returns users annd their subscriptions, along with a new column called activity_levels that makes a judgement based on the number of subscriptions

SELECT first_name, surname, subscriptions
CASE WHEN subscriptions > 10 THEN 'Very active'
WHEN Quantity BETWEEN 3 AND 10 THEN 'Active'
ELSE 'Inactive'
END AS activity_levels
FROM users;



CHECK
            CREATE TABLE 	users (
            first_name varchar(255),
          age int,
       CHECK (age>=18)
        );

Example 2(MySQL) Adds a check after  the table has already been created

ALTER TABLE users
ADD CHECK (age>=18);


CREATE DATABASE :
    Creates a new database
      Example: Creates a new database named 'websitesetup'
      CREATE DATABASE websiteup;



CREATE TABLE :
                  CREATE TABLE users (
                  id int,
                  first_name varchar(255),
                  surname varchar(255),
                  address varchar(255)
                 contact_number int
                   );


DEFAULT   :                  CREATE TABLE products (
                            id int,
                            name varchar(255) DEFAULT 'Placeholder Name',
                            available_from date DEFAULT GETDATE()
                               );

                      ALTER TABLE products
                     ALTER name SET DEFAULT 'Placeholder Name',
                      ALTER available_from SET DEFAULT GETDATE();


DELETE Delete data from a table
Example   : Removes a user with a user_id = 674;

DESC       :    Used with ORDER BY to return the data in descending order.
          



DROP COLUMN :Deletes a column from a table
                 ALTER TABLE users
                 DROP COLUMN first_name

DROP DATABASE       : Deletes the entire database
                      Drop DATABASE websitesetup;

DROP DEAFULT   :           Removes a default value for a column 
                         ALTER TABLE products
                         ALTER COLUMN name DROP DEFAULT;

DROP TABLE        :        Deletes a table from a database
                           Examples: Removes the users table

EXISTS:                  Checks for the existence of any record within the subquery , returning true if one or more records are returned
                       SELECT dealership_name
                       FROM dealerships
                     WHERE EXIXTX (SELECT deal_name FROM deals WHERE dealership_id = deals.dealership_id AND finance_percenatge < 10);

FROM    :             Specifis which table to select otr delete data from
                     SELECT are_manager
                     FROM area_managers
                     WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ProductName FROM Products WHERE
                     are_manager_id = deals.are_manager_id AND Price < 20);
