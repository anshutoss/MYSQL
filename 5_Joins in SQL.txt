In SQL , a JOIN clause is used to return a reuslts set which combines data from multiple tables,
based on a common column which is featured in both of them

There are a number of different joins available for you to use:

1. Inner Join (Default): Returns any records which have matching values in both tables
2.Left Join: Returns all of the records from the first table, along with any matching records from the second table

3. Right Join: Returns all of the record from the second table, along with any matching records from the first

4. Full Join: Returns all records from both tables when there ia a match

SELECT orders.id, users.first_name, users.surname, products.name as 'product name' 
FROM orders
INNER JOIN users on orders.user_id  = users.id
INNER JOIN products on orders.product_id = products.id;


VIEW

A view is essentially a SQL results set that get stored in the database under a label, so you can return to it later, without having to rerun the query.
These are especially useful when you have a costly SQL query which may be needed a number of times, so instead of running it over and over to generate the same results set, you can just do it once and save it as a view.

	Creating Views

              CREATE VIEW priority_users AS
              SELECT * FROM users
             WHERE country = 'United Kingdom';
    
                 Then in future, if you need to access the stored result set, you can do so like this:
              SELECT * FROM [priority_users];


Replacing Views

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW [priority_users]  AS
SELECT * FROM users
WHERE country = 'United Kingdom' OR country='USA' ;

Deleting Views

To delerte a view, simply use the DROP VIEW command

DROP VIEW priority_users;
