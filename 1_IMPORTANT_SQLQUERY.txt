1. SELECT * FROM users;
USING this SELECT statement , the query selects all data from all columns in the user's table

2. SELCT first_name, last_name FROM users;
Only data from these two columns would be returned from the query table

3. SELECT * FROM products WHERE stcok_count <= 10 ORDER BY stock_count ASC;
This query would return all data from the products table with a  stock_count value of less than 10 in its results set. The use of the ORDER By keyword means the results will be ordered using the stock_count column , lowest to highest

4.Using the INSERT INTO statement we can add new data to a table. Here's a basic example adding a new user to the users table
INSERT INTO users (first_name, last_name, address, email)
VALUES ('Tester', 'Jester', '123 Fake Street, Sheffield, United Kingdom', 'test@lukeharrison.dev');

SQL is the language It outlines syntax that allows you to write queries that manage relational databases. Nothing more.
MySQL meanwhile is a database system that runs on a server. It implements the SQL language, allowing you to write queries using its syntax to manage MySQL databases.

In addition to MySQL, there are other systems that implements SQL. Some of the more popular ones include PostgreSQL , SQLite, Oracle Database
Microsoft SQL Server.
